                <h1>Photography</h1>
                <p> I started getting into photography my Junior year of High School.
                    I thought it was really interesting what you could do with it. When I start taking pictures I didn't know much about it.
                    I would usually go out and take pictures of forests and water, but I started to research and found out you can do a lot more with the pictures you take.
                    I started learning how to edit photos and mesisng with the colors in the backround.
