    <h1>Music</h1>
    
        <p>Music is a big part of my life. 
            I've been in choir since the 6th grade and its shown me how to appreciate it in many was.
             I use to only stick to one kind of music but started to look into different types 3 years ago.
             The only music I listened too were the popular ones that all my friend liked, but I moved away 
             from that to find more music that I personaly liked. Music shapes the way people act, changes moods, brings back memories, and makes new ones.

      <h2>Kanye West</h2>

      <p>Despite Kanye's life style I really enjoy his music.
            I think it's very interesting in how he makes his music.
            Instead of using musicle instruments he will most likey use his or other artist voice for the part.
            He has shaped and motivated ways other artist make their music.
            His last album "Ye" was about how he was feeling and his respnse to everyone comemtning abourt his mental break down.
            Instead of trying to make "bangers" he took a different route to express himself. In and interview he said it was like a big gospel.
            This is one of the main reasons I love muscic because you can see someone change and listen to how they feel about the world.

            <p>About two years ago I was hanging out with my friend and she introduced me to a band called The Gorillaz
                .I was heasitant because of the name but oonce she showed me their music video I imediatly became a fan.
                The Gorillaz is a virtual band, as in they all cartoon. Every music video they have made has been a 5 min or longer cartoon.
                I thought it was so cool and loved their music. Only two people are in the band. One is the artist and the other creats the animation.
                 They are famous for their animated videos and collab with many other artist. They mainly collab wit small and big artist's.
                 I like thier music because its very chill and mellow.
