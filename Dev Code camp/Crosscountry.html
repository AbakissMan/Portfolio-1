            <p> My love for running started in 6th grade. When I first started I was placing 5th last or 3rd last, but as I continued to run I got better.
                By 8th grade I was starting to finish top top 10 and top 5. When I got into highschool the world of running got mcuh bigger for me.
                Freshman year was like starting all over again, High School was on another level of running. Freshman year I pushed myself to get on the
                the varsity team. My Junior year I finally made varsity.</p>

            <p> Running in track is way different than running cross country. 
                They use the different leg muscles,
                so everytime I started track my thighs would kill me. 
                I like Track because I love
                how competitive it is. 
                When I started I did the open 400m run annd 4x4 . 
                Later in my junior and senior
                year I did the open 800m and 4x8. </p>
